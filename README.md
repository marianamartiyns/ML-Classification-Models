# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Classifiers: Neural Network, Decision Tree & SVM

> Classification models applied to the National Health Survey dataset (PNS - 2019) using Machine Learning techniques.

### > ðŸ“‹ Description

This repository explores three popular classification algorithms in Machine Learning: **Neural Network**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Decision Tree**. These models are applied to the 2019 National Health Survey (PNS) dataset, conducted by the Ministry of Health in partnership with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The dataset provides insights into various health indicators across Brazil.

### > ðŸ§© Performance Analysis

- [x] **Accuracy Comparison**: Evaluating and comparing the accuracy of each model.
- [x] **Precision, Recall & F1-Score**: Calculating these metrics to analyze model performance, particularly for imbalanced classes.
